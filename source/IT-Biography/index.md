My name is Mathias Meeusen, 18 years old and I’m attending the Immaculata Institute in Oostmalle. I’m currently in my last year of IT and network management.  
 
I first came in contact with IT during nursery school or one of my first few
years in primary school, I can’t quite remember my exact age. I got a Game Boy Color
for my birthday with a simple game or two. While I was growing older I
continued to upgrade the hardware I played my games on. I loved gaming from the
first time I played on my Game Boy and I still love gaming now. Most of my
current gaming takes places on my computer. Occasionally I pull one of my
handhelds or old consoles out of the closet to get that nostalgic feeling.
Because of my interest in gaming and moving to the pc for gaming, I
became intrigued by the machine and how it functions. Every time I wanted a new
computer game I had to check if our pc could run it.  This is one of the reason why I became
interested about the inside of a pc. All the different component, what
specifications they have, etc.
 
Outside of school I’m not actively
searching for articles or browsing the web looking for IT-sites. However, when
I come across an IT-related article I become curious of its contents. I spend a
lot of hours behind my pc alternating between work and games.
I’m fascinated by how advanced everything has become. I have first-hand
experience with a computer running on Windows ’98. My setting now exists of a
Windows 8 laptop and a second monitor connected. My computer is also
quite important for sustaining my social contacts. Apart from school I barely
set foot outside. I don’t like going to a party or visiting a city or something
along the lines. Those things are all too crowded. So thanks to social media
and software like skype I can talk to my friends outside of school.
 
In the near future I want to finish secondary school and keep
studying so I can get a good degree. With that I’d like to get is a job at the
IT section of a company. I don’t see myself driving around to companies or
homes to install hardware.
 
I think it’s safe to say my life is very intertwined with my pc. I use it daily for school and entertainment.
